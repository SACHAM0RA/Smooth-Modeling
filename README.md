# Smooth-Modeling
A new technique for improving symbolic execution and solving real nonlinear constraints.

In folder "SatFuncGenerator" you find a C# project that generates corresponding approximative satisfaction functions of any given constraint.

In folder "Optimization" you find MATLAB codes that implement the maximization of approximative satisfaction functions, which is equivalent to solving their corresponding constrints.
